<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a visually stunning, premium, dark-themed landing page for a managed talent marketplace called Nego. The development should be based on several reference images provided by the user.

The project has evolved through numerous iterative requests, including:
- Building out sections for Hero, About, Talent, and Private Content.
- Removing sections (Services, Testimonials).
- Implementing specific fonts (Playfair Display, DM Sans).
- Making the entire page responsive.
- Implementing a Bento Grid (Masonry Layout) for content sections.
- Adding extensive animations and interactivity (Framer Motion, CSS).
- Changing the color scheme to a red-based theme.
- Updating the icon library to Phosphor Icons.
- Creating and maintaining a  document.
- Multiple text and layout adjustments based on user feedback.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete, frontend-only landing page for Nego has been built using React and Tailwind CSS. It features a dark theme, custom fonts (Playfair and DM Sans), a hero section with an image slider, an About Us section with a Bento grid layout, a Talent section in a masonry layout, a Premium Content section, and a footer. The page is responsive and includes animations and interactivity. A design system document is available at . All frontend data is currently mocked from .

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was modifying the main Call-to-Action (CTA) button, Negotiate, in the hero section. The user requested its hover state to be the inverse of its default state. The default state is a solid red button with a white icon.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done**: Y (Agent used the screenshot tool, but the result was inconclusive for verifying the hover effect).
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: . The agent needs to verify a visual CSS hover state.
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1**: Main CTA button hover state is not correctly implemented. (Priority: P0)

  **Issues Detail**:
  *   **Issue 1: Main CTA button hover state is not correctly implemented.**
      *   **Attempted fixes**: The agent modified  to change the button's style. However, the screenshot verification did not clearly confirm if the inverse hover effect was working as requested.
      *   **Next debug checklist**:
          1.  Review  to inspect the Tailwind CSS classes applied for the  state on the button and its icon.
          2.  Ensure the hover state correctly inverts the colors (e.g., from a red background with a white icon to a white/transparent background with a red icon and text).
          3.  Check  for any conflicting global styles or animations.
          4.  Use the screenshot tool again to verify the fix on the button's hover state.
      *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To fulfill the user's explicit design requirement for the button's interactivity and ensure a consistent user experience.
      *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
      *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
      *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
      *   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
There are no other tasks in progress. The focus is on the pending issue above.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Backend Development and Integration (P0)**: The entire application is currently frontend-only. The next major phase is to build the backend and connect it to the frontend.
    *   Create MongoDB models for talent, users, etc.
    *   Build FastAPI endpoints to serve data for all sections (talent list, private content).
    *   Replace all mocked data in  and components with live API calls.
    *   Implement the business logic for the Negotiate CTA.
    *   Implement user authentication to handle access to Private Content.

*   **Iterative Design Refinements**:
    *   Removed Services and Testimonials sections.
    *   Redesigned About Us section with a Bento Grid layout using new images.

*   **Styling and Theming**:
    *   Integrated custom fonts:  (headings) and  (body).
    *   Changed the color palette from purple-based to a red-based theme ().
    *   Styled the browser scrollbar to match the new theme.
*   **Interactivity and Animations**:
    *   Made the entire application responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
    *   Added a scroll-aware blurred background to the header.
    *   Implemented numerous entrance and hover animations using CSS keyframes and Framer Motion across all sections.
    *   Replaced Lucide Icons with Phosphor Icons.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend**: React.js
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, custom CSS animations ( in ).
*   **Animation**: Framer Motion for component-level animations and interactivity.
*   **UI Components**: Primarily custom-built components with Shadcn/UI primitives available.
*   **Architecture**: Component-based architecture with all data mocked in .

**key DB schema**
N/A (No database has been implemented yet).

**changes in tech stack**
*    was added as the primary icon library.

**All files of reference**
*   : Main application component, combines all landing page sections.
*   : Contains global styles, font imports, custom CSS variables, and all animation keyframes.
*   : Directory containing all section components.
    *   : Contains the main CTA button that needs to be fixed.
*   : Central file for all mocked data used across the UI.
*   : The single source of truth for design guidelines, colors, fonts, and components.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None at the moment. The code is modular. The next step will be to replace mock data with API calls, which is an implementation task rather than refactoring.

**key api endpoints**
N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   The entire application is a **frontend-only prototype**. All content is hardcoded or comes from .
*   The immediate next step is to fix the main CTA's hover effect in .
*   The most significant upcoming task is building the backend and integrating it, as the user has not yet requested this.
*   All design decisions, including colors, fonts, and component styles, are documented in . Refer to this file for any UI changes.
